While Ruby is not a functional programming language, that doesn't mean that it
can't put on a good show. Using Ruby 1.9.2, this presentation gives a brief
introduction to a few aspects of functional programming and how Ruby fits into
that niche.

There are links to several references at the end of the presentation.
